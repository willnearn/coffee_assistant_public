- Purchased by current owners in 2005
- Elevation is 1200-1800 ft above sea level, pool and hilltop are 1600 ft

# Kona Region
- 30 mile by 1 mile stretch (north to south x ocean to mountain)
- Growing region is 600-3000 feet above sea level 
- Have to be grown in Kona to be called Kona
- 100% Kona is state certification to be called Kona Coffee is based on size and quality and where it is grown
- Special microclimate made up of multiple factors
  - Volcanic soil filled with nutrients and minerals
  - Volcanic rock foundation so the water can flow right through to the aquifers and no flooding
  - Perfect rainfall caused by inversion layer
    - Made up from warm breezes from the western side and cold Tradewinds coming in from the eastern side. 
    - They collide on top of Mauna Loa creating clouds that come back over to cover Kona 
    - So we get rain almost every afternoon
    - This also helps with shade grown 
    - Coffee needs shade, when trees get sunburnt they produce acidity

# History
- Coffee brought to Hawaii from South America in 1813, brought to Oahu by Don Francisco de Paula as a gift to chief, did not survive
- 1817 trees brought from Brazil to Oahu
- 1825 trees brought from Brazil to Hawaii again
- 1828 trees brought to Kona by Reverend Samuel L Ruggles, planted in Hawaii
- 1850 Henry Greenwell established Greenwell Farms and started the commercial coffee farming industry in Kona
- 1873, Henry Greenwell brought Kona Coffee to the Vienna world's fair, introducing Kona Coffee to the world and starting the international popularity
- Coffee Industry grew over the next few years, alongside sugar cane, pineapple, and macadamia nut. Each one taking over then being phased out. 
- 1970's the price of Macadamia nuts becomes more expensive to pick than the selling price, so many farms transitioned over into coffee. 
- 1994 Heavenly Hawaiian established as a coffee farm by Kraig Lee


# Types of Coffee 
## Species
- Arabica - 70% of global coffee production
  - All the coffee grown on the farm for consumption is 100% Arabica
- Robusta - 28% of global coffee production
- Excelsa - 1% of global coffee production
- Liberia - 1% of global coffee production

# Hawaii Growing facts
- Hawaii has 11 out of 13 climate zones
- Missing arctic tundra and Sahara dessert
- Also have several microclimates within those climates, like the one particular to Kona
- Basically means Hawaii can grow almost every agricultural plant in the world

# Life of a coffee plant
- January-march are flowerings (also called Kona Snow)
- Each flower becomes a cherry and they grow from March to July/August
- 1 harvest season each year
- Harvest starts around August and we pick until about December or January (sometimes February)
- Coffee beans are only picked when they are ripe and red/burgundy color
  - Ripe coffee cherries means better flavor in the beans

# Coffee Pickers 
- all coffee is hand picked when the cherries are ripe and red
- Our pickers come in for 6 months typically from Dominican Republic or Mexico
- We ask all pickers to pick only the ripe red cherries
- They start before the sun comes up, and pick as long as they want, usually allowing for breaks in the afternoon because of the hot sun
- They pick as much as they can, and we pay them each by the pound so the harder they work, the better they get paid
- Average picker picks 100-450lbs in a day but the record is 850. 
- Pickers make around $1/lb
- Thus they can make anywhere from $100-$450-$850/day
- Pickers can get up to top of trees by using a stick with a hook and rope attached, pulling down branches gently and picking off that branch (kinda need a visual for this)
- They use the white buckets that they carry around like front facing backpacks, and they also have a belt around the waist to help balance the weight

# Coffee Processing
- coffee goes bad right after picking so much process every night
- The coffee gets weighed, pickers are paid what they are due
- Coffee gets poured into the hopper, then the flow is controlled by the stick into the machine
- The stainless steel vat below is filled up with water, and the bad cherries that are damaged from beetles or other things float to the top, we scoop those out and can process them later to be used for other coffee related products like soaps, extracts, etc. 
- The coffee that sinks to the bottom has a high density, which means that the coffee is good, so it gets pumped through the tube, and into a second set of density checks
- This 2nd stainless vat gets rid of things that are too heavy
  - Rocks
  - Cell phones
  - Things that fall into machine get stuck in the valleys
- The good cherries just float on through and go to what looks like a spinning cheese grater that cuts the skin off the cherries. They then go through a series of augers then to a de-mucelizer where they have the mucilage taken off (slimy fruit pectin layer)
- Then transferred onto the deck where they sit to dry for 1/1.5 weeks
- Raked with the rake every hour from 7-5pm to dry beans evenly
- When they are dry (between 9-12% moisture level), they are bagged up in burlap and stored in temperature and humidity controlled vaults
- From there, the coffee sits for 2 months to allow the complex sugars to break down and help lower acidity
- Then we take out the coffee to "Dry Mill"
  - Removing of the parchment layer
  - Separating out the beans by size and quality
    - Extra Fancy - largest bean size (19mm) and less than 1% defects
    - Fancy - 18mm bean size and less than 5%
    - Number 1 - 17mm and less than 8%
    - Select - 16+mm and less than 12%
    - Prime - 16mm and less than 15%
    - We only Offer Extra Fancy and Estate (combined Fancy, #1, Select, and Prime)
      - to make it easier to decide
      - We produce more extra fancy grade than any other bean grade
